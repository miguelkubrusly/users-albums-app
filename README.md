# Users-Albums

//todo: verify at end of project

Users-Albums is a React application built with TypeScript and Redux Toolkit, designed as part of the **Modern React with Redux [2024 Update]** course. This project allows you to manage users, their albums, and images within each album. It leverages `json-server` as a mock API and `axios` for data fetching. All data, including users, albums, and images, are generated randomly using `faker`.

## Features

- **User Management:** Create, read, update, and delete users.
- **Album Management:** Manage albums for each user.
- **Image Handling:** Add and view images within each album.
- **Random Data Generation:** Uses `faker` to generate realistic dummy data.
- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for efficient state management.
- **API Interaction:** Communicates with a mock API using `axios` and `json-server`.

## Technologies Used

- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **json-server** for mock API
- **axios** for HTTP requests
- **faker** for generating dummy data
- **React Router** for routing
- **CSS Modules** for styling

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/users-albums.git
   cd users-albums
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up `json-server`:**

   The project uses `json-server` to create a mock API. Ensure you have it installed globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```

4. **Generate mock data:**

   The project includes a script to generate fake data using `faker`. Run the following command to generate `db.json`:

   ```bash
   npm run generate-data
   ```

5. **Start the mock API server:**

   In one terminal window, run:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```

6. **Start the React application:**

   In another terminal window, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- **View Users:** Navigate to the Users section to see a list of all users.
- **Manage Albums:** Click on a user to view and manage their albums.
- **Add Images:** Within an album, add or view images.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on users, albums, and images.
